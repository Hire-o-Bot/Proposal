\section{Scope and Applications of the Project}
The idea behind the project is to provide the recruiters a complete portal to seamlessly automate the hiring process. The portal will encapsulate features. The portal will help dintinguish candidates based on their applications. It will also run machine learning algorithms with computer vision to assess and evaluate the performance of candidates during the interview.
Following are the main applications of this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Candidates can use our portal for mock interview
    \item Our platform can help companies to evaluate the interviewee
    \item Companies that are providing hiring services to other companies can also use our platform for selecting candidates
\end{itemize}
